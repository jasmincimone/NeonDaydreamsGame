Used the following tutorial to help me build the code for the flip functions and check for match funtion. (https://marina-ferreira.github.io/tutorials/js/memory-game/)

Neon Daydreams is an adventure matching game that uses prompts and a grid full of animojis to create a game within my fictional world, "Neon Daydreams!"
The game will start with my talking animoji and alerts that say: "Welcome to Neon Daydreams! This is a new era of nurturing daydreams! In this world, all of your dreams that you hold close can all come true. 

-HOWEVER, There's a catch!!!
-The EVIL MR. NIGHTMARE is waiting in the wings to turn all your dreams into your worst nightmares. You have to match the icons shown on each level so that you can beat MR. NIGHTMARE (computer) and get back to chasing your wildest and most beautiful dreams! 
-Please read the rules of the game, and PAY ATTENTION! Each time you miss, you give MR. NIGHTMARE another chance to win!!!

RULES OF THE GAME
- In order to help JiCS get back to Neon Daydreams, you have to find the matching icon below. 

- You will have a chance to turn over 2 cards. If you don’t find the match, it’s Mr. Nightmare’s turn to find the match.

-You have to find the match before Mr. Nightmare, or JiCS’ beautiful Neon Daydream will turn into a nightmare!!!!!
